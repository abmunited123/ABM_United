  <h5>Managing large-scale deployment and support for
computers and laptops during COVID-19</h5>
<p><span class="drkblue">The catch:</span> When the pandemic restricted the movement of people, it became difficult for the workforce to continue working and the challenge was to work on mobilizing resources for the team to work seamlessly.</p>

<p><span class="drkblue">The way forward:</span> The government and employers needed to provide millions of laptops,
   computers and peripheral devices to employees, and all of this hardware required support that ensures minimum 
   downtime, even in remote areas.</p>

<p><span class="drkblue">The opportunity:</span> The ABM United team turned this crisis into an opportunity to scale up
  . More than <b>5 lack</b> laptops were distributed and subsequently given maintenance support by our team.</p>

<p><span class="drkblue">The solution:</span> ABM United’s intelligent field force backed with technology and automation.</p>

<p class="extraparaspace">When the pandemic took our nation and the world into a zone where physical
   movement of people and products was virtually brought to a standstill, ABM United developed an action plan
    to bridge the gap between Gram Panchayats, Armed Forces, and Banks in the remotest corners across India. The 
    team rolled out support services across <span>20,000</span> locations and covered across
    <span>500</span> Gram Panchayats, Armed Forces, and ‘brown label’ ATM vendors in India.
    The network provided last-mile connectivity to <span>20,000</span> bank branches, <span>5,000</span> 
    Railway Recruitment Control Boards, and <span>5,000 </span>Cooperative Banks. We ensured that the
    ATM network remained available so that millions of people in the remotest corners of India could have access and 
    stay connected. </p>

<p>With extensive use of intelligent field force automation, we are able to manage these staggering numbers
   effectively to quickly respond and resolve customer problems. Our solutions help complex management with 
   intelligent automated routing and accurate geo-positioning modules that ensure the fastest responses than any 
   other standard industry tool in the world. Most importantly, we manage more than <span>50,000</span> tickets per month across our field 
  services spectrum that includes network, personal computing devices, servers, network, and security assets.</p>

<p>With <span>Mobizone</span>, we present complex information in a simplified and dynamic manner, which makes it incredibly attractive when it comes to responding in an effortless way. And, our <span>1,500+</span> workforce across India remains connected and tracks their well-being, helping each employee manage their daily attendance, tasks, conveyance claims, manage order parts without having to send manual requests and reports.</p>

<p><span class="drkblue">The opportunity:</span> The bank planned to implement Microsoft Bitlocker which was based on several considerations, such as compliance with Reserve Bank of India directive to Indian banks for a Windows upgrade to the latest version (RBI Mandate) 21H2 version, eliminate current support issues with the existing encryption tool, reduce maintenance costs and migrate to an inbuilt solution from Microsoft. The opportunity at hand was massive in terms of sheer volumes. </p>
